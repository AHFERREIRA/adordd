adordd for (x)Harbour

Most part of adordd its done!
Its working on trial phase in real app.

The speed can be increased with the use of indexes on the server side for the fields used as RECNO  by adorddd.
Configuration of cacheSize and MaxRecords can also has a huge impact of speed.

There are still some issues please read notes in tryadordd.prg.
