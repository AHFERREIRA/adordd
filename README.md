PLEASE MAKE A DONATION!

We will all profit for sure from such development so I think its fair to ask everyone to contribute with a minimal 
importance of 20 Euros (because of the paypal costs) for a good cause.

Some of you are asking how to contribute other than PayPal.

Now you have it.

Go to http://ajusera.com scroll down and you will see bank details:

TRANSFERÊNCIA BANCÁRIA = BANK TRANSFER

You can transfer to those account details or continue to click PayPal button "Doar".

They can send you a contribution receipt if you send them a email with your details.

This is a non profit organization that performs an important social work supporting the elderly, 
young problematic, food distribution to the needy, etc.
This organization is based on the work of Father Jeronimo Usera (spanish) well known in
Spain, Portugal and South America.

You can get more information at http://ajusera.com (sorry its only in portuguese)

Please join with your solidarity. Come on.

To start working please check readme.pdf or leeme.pdf
