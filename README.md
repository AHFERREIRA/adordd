adordd for (x)Harbour

04.05.15

Most part of adordd its done!
Its working on trial phase in real app some small bugs have been corrected since last version.

Absolutely no code change required. 

The speed can be increased with the use of indexes on the server side for the fields used as RECNO  by adorddd.
Configuration of cacheSize and MaxRecords can also has a huge impact of speed.

Please read notes in tryadordd.prg.
